"Mahmoud Khatami , an Iranian philosopher at the University of Tehran , was subject to plagiarism accusations in 2014 . A retraction for one article by Khatami due to plagiarism appeared in the philosophy journal Topoi , accompanied by an editorial by the journal editor that confirmed the existence of plagiarism . Julian Young 's Friedrich Nietzsche : A Philosophical Biography ( Cambridge University Press , 2010 ) contains passages plagiarized from an earlier biography by Curtis Cate . Young later had corrections and proper attribution to Cate 's biography inserted into unsold copies of the book . == Physics and engineering == Ranga P. Dias ( US ) , a physicist formerly at the University of Rochester , was in 2024 found by an investigatory committee to have committed research misconduct , including data fabrication and falsification , related to his work on alleged superconducting materials . A 2023 report in Science noted that at least 21 % of Dias 's 2013 doctoral thesis had been plagiarised . As of 2024 , Dias has had five of his research papers retracted , and five other papers have received an expression of concern . Victor Ninov ( US ) ,","– In many scientific fields , the most lucrative options for professionals are often selling opinions . Corporations can pay experts to support products directly or indirectly via conferences . Psychologists can make money by repeatedly acting as an expert witness in custody proceedings for the same law firms . == Roles == === Scientists === All authors of a scientific publication are expected to have made reasonable attempts to check findings submitted to academic journals for publication . Simultaneous submission of scientific findings to more than one journal or duplicate publication of findings is usually regarded as misconduct , under what is known as the Ingelfinger rule , named after the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine 1967–1977 , Franz Ingelfinger . Guest authorship ( where there is stated authorship in the absence of involvement , also known as gift authorship ) and ghost authorship ( where the real author is not listed as an author ) are commonly regarded as forms of research misconduct . In some cases coauthors of faked research have been accused of inappropriate behavior or research misconduct for failing to verify reports authored by others or by a commercial sponsor . Examples",0
"allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores ) , the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying , rather than as complements to studying , and thus spent less time preparing for the exam . ==== Teachers ==== The federal government of the United States has mandated high-stakes testing as part of the No Child Left Behind Act , signed into law in 2002 . Schools and teachers are held accountable for the results . According to Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner , co-authors of Freakonomics , teachers are known to `` teach to the test '' : while not teaching the actual answers , they teach the questions and similar ones , and they neglect any topic that will not be tested on . Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in their classroom . Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work . === Demographic and personal causes === Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating , including age , gender and grade point average .","his speech the longest since at least the 1972 Republican National Convention and one of the longest acceptance speeches ever in major-party convention history . In his speech , Trump stated that America faces a `` crisis '' due to `` attacks on our police '' and `` terrorism in our cities , '' and emphasized an important theme in his campaign : law and order . In evaluating the speech , Glenn Thrush of Politico noted the influence of Richard Nixon , Spiro Agnew , Ronald Reagan , and Rudy Giuliani , all of whom sounded similar themes earlier in American history in attempts to win over the `` Silent Majority '' . Trump also promised to limit American participation in global crises and trade deals . When Trump turned to the subject of illegal immigration , many in the audience began shouting `` Build the wall , build the wall , '' referring to a signature promise of Trump 's campaign to build a wall on the Mexico–United States border . Trump also repeatedly attacked President Barack Obama and the Democratic presumptive nominee , Hillary Clinton , arguing that the country and world had become less safe during",0
", and official self-serving pieties of the World War II establishment to uncover the idiosyncratic people at its center . '' Ambrose also wrote a three-volume biography of Richard Nixon . Although Ambrose was a strong critic of Nixon , the biography was considered fair and just regarding Nixon 's presidency . A visit to a reunion of Easy Company veterans in 1988 prompted Ambrose to collect their stories , turning them into Band of Brothers , E Company , 506th Regiment , 101st Airborne : From Normandy to Hitler 's Eagle 's Nest ( 1992 ) . D-Day ( 1994 ) , built upon additional oral histories , presented the battle from the view points of individual soldiers and became his first best seller . A reviewer for the Journal of Military History commended D-Day as the `` most comprehensive discussion '' of the sea , air , and land operations that coalesced on that day .

On the afternoon of July 18 , 2016 , a group of delegates sought to force a roll-call vote on the proposed convention rules package adopted by the Rules Committee . Some who demanded a roll call vote sought to change the party rules package to `` unbind '' delegates so that on the first ballot , delegates could `` vote their conscience '' and conceivably block Trump from being nominated on the first ballot ; such a move would also `` allow Trump opponents a platform to argue against '' Trump . Others demanding a roll call vote were seeking to reform party rules to decentralize power from the RNC and make changes for the 2020 primary process . That morning , a petition for a roll call vote was submitted with the signatures of a majority of delegates from ten states . That afternoon , the presiding officer , Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas , did not recognize delegates clamoring for recognition over the rules package for the convention . Womack first declared the previous question was ordered by unanimous consent despite loud cries of objection . The rules were then adopted by voice",0

This also coincided with the period of exponential growth of doctorates in Serbia . In 100 years , from 1905 ( when Belgrade University was organized as such and organized doctoral studies ) to 2005 , on all universities which were formed in time , there were 16,860 doctorates . In the next 8 years , from 2006 to 2013 , there were 9,000 , with additional 15,000 doctoral students . There were 205 doctorates in 2007 , 770 in 2012 and 2,012 in 2016 . In only one week in 2016 , 187 doctorates were awarded . The paradox is that the number of students in Serbia is below the European average compared to the total population , but the number of doctoral students is well above . One mentor has up to 15 students . 2014 survey showed that 65 % of the faculties had no plagiarism procedure , and out of the remaining 35 % , only few were able to explain what the procedure actually looks like . == Doctorate ==","and , in a handful of cases , contain lies about the methodology '' .

"hackers looking for weak spots in the convention 's network . The computer network of the Democratic National Committee had already been penetrated by hackers linked with the Russian government , compromising , among other things , the database of opposition research on Trump . On July 17 , 2016 , The New York Times reported that `` Cleveland has assigned about 500 police officers specifically to handle the convention and it has brought in thousands more officers to help , from departments as distant as California and Texas . '' === Protest planning === The Los Angeles Times wrote at the end of March 2016 that fears of a turbulent and volatile convention atmosphere were heightened because of a variety of factors : `` a city scarred by controversial police shootings and simmering with racial tension ; a candidate [ Trump ] who has threatened that his supporters will riot if he comes with the most delegates but leaves without the nomination ; and a police force with a reputation for brutality . '' Concerns specifically focused on the ability of the Cleveland Police Department to handle protests in the wake of the Tamir Rice and Michael Brelo cases","to go with him to the exams . In February 2020 , daily Politika published an article on fake theses , after interviewing one of the ghost writers , who was familiar with the business since 2008 but knows some cases from the 1990s . It takes about two months to draft the doctorate but those who are more skilled or versed can compile it in a month . Some openly advertise their work on the Internet but majority still operates on recommendation , especially after the scandals broke out . They also write graduate and undergraduate dissertations , scientific works , etc . Minimal price is €1,000 . The client provides the subject and basic literature , while the rest of the sources are procured online by the ghost writer or `` if we take a real effort , we go to the library '' . Special attention is given to the parts that mentor is paying extra attention to . The interviewee admitted having a guilty conscience sometimes , but if he does n't take the job someone else would , and he needs money . However , he expressed his surprise with the complete lack of guilt",0
"and corruption of intellectual elite . The doctorate of Mali was one in the series of Serbian education-related scandals since 2014 , regarding dubious diplomas , master 's degrees and doctorates of the high-profile public persons , mainly politicians ( Tomislav Nikolić , Nebojša Stefanović , Mića Jovanović , Jorgovanka Tabaković , Aleksandar Martinović , Igor Bečić , Aleksandar Šapić , Jelena Trivan , Aleksandar Vulin , Aleksandar Antić , Zoran Đorđević ) . Mali 's doctorate was the first annulled by the university itself ( Jovanović 's doctorate was declared non-existing earlier , in 2014 , but it was done by Srđan Verbić , Minister of Education at the time ) . On 11 March 2015 European Parliament expressed concerns that neither academia nor political institutions deal with the problem of plagiarism . In 2018 , membership of the National Entity for Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education of Serbia ( NAT ) in the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education was reduced from full membership to the adjoining member . This also coincided with the period of exponential growth of doctorates in Serbia . In 100 years , from 1905 ( when Belgrade University was","judicial boards have high rates of cheating . Whereas faculty or administration run codes of conduct tend to rely on policing and punishment to deter students from cheating , honor codes tend to rely on and cultivate student senses of honor and group peer pressure to deter academic misconduct . === Faculty issues in deterring academic dishonesty === There are limitations to relying on the faculty to police academic dishonesty . One study found that up to 21 % of professors have ignored at least one clear cut case of cheating . Another study revealed that 40 % of professors `` never '' report cheating , 54 % `` seldom '' report cheating , and that a mere 6 % act on all cases of academic misconduct that confront them . A third survey of professors found that while 79 % had observed cheating , only 9 % had penalized the student . Another study suggests that plagiarism detection software is rarely used , while university teachers try to detect plagiarism through careful reading . This study also found that different versions of tests are used comparatively infrequently in examinations , for example by trying to ensure sufficient distance between",0
"it 's inappropriate . I do n't think that 's the right thing to do . '' Kasich attended events outside the convention hall in support of down-ballot Republican candidates . As the convention began , the Trump campaign lashed out at Kasich for his failure to endorse , prompting an exchange that The New York Times called `` remarkably bitter '' and `` the latest extraordinary turn in a campaign that has veered sharply away from political precedent . '' Manafort called Kasich `` petulant '' and accused him of `` embarrassing his party , '' prompting Kasich chief political aide John Weaver to mock Trump and criticize Manafort for his work on behalf of foreign `` thugs and autocrats '' abroad . === Schedule === On July 17 , 2016 , the convention planners released the convention 's official schedule of events and speakers , along with themes . ( An early , preliminary roster of speakers , `` confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of the convention planning , '' had been obtained and published by the New York Times several days earlier . ) The schedule of speakers is as follows : Monday , July","with this problem . Noam Chomsky called ChatGPT `` nothing more than high-tech plagiarism '' . In contrast , others have proposed that `` the essay is dead '' , declaring that artificial intelligence will transform academia and society . One scholar of plagiarism , Eaton , proposed the idea of a postplagiarism era , in which human and artificial-intelligence hybrid writing become normal . The impact of artificial intelligence on plagiarism has yet to be fully understood , but LLMs have triggered a huge wave of content automation and this poses a risk of saturation of the internet . A 2024 study from researchers in Singapore shows how this misuse of artificial intelligence for automated content creation at scale could lead to a 'Plagiarism Singularity ' in the near future , where most original work would also be marked as plagiarised due to a massive amount of artificially generated content on the internet . The widespread use of artificial intelligence creates trouble for colleges . With ChatGPT 's strong database and convenience , students who see much of the work assigned by professors as just busywork will complete the work via artificial intelligence .

"publish or perish '' . This pressure is stronger in some research settings than others , contributing to the increased prevalence of misconduct in some parts of the world than others . This may motivate desperate ( or fame-hungry ) scientists to fabricate results . Ease of fabrication – In many scientific fields , results are often difficult to reproduce accurately , being obscured by noise , artifacts , and other extraneous data . That means that even if a scientist does falsify data , they may expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field . There are few strongly backed systems to investigate possible violations , attempt to press charges , or punish deliberate misconduct . It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data .

"generally requires the adversary to have access to more mining power than the rest of the network combined . The mining process in bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer processing power . Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks , which are then verified by the network . Each block must contain a proof of work ( PoW ) to be accepted , involving finding a nonce number that , combined with the block content , produces a hash numerically smaller than the network 's difficulty target . This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate , requiring many attempts . PoW forms the basis of bitcoin 's consensus mechanism . The difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target , which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks ( approximately two weeks ) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks . The process requires significant computational power and specialized hardware .

In one case , Nature allowed a corrigendum to be published despite clear evidence of image fraud . Subsequent retraction of the paper required the actions of an independent whistleblower . The cases of Joachim Boldt and Yoshitaka Fujii in anaesthesiology focussed attention on the role that journals play in perpetuating scientific fraud as well as how they can deal with it . In the Boldt case , the editors-in-chief of 18 specialist journals ( generally anesthesia and intensive care ) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval . In the Fujii case , involving nearly 200 papers , the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia , which published 24 of Fujii 's papers , has accepted that its handling of the issue was inadequate .

One professor wrote in an article in The English Journal that when he peeked in on an unproctored class taking a test and saw several students up and consulting with one another , he decided that they were not cheating , but were using non-traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way .

"Comparative Analysis of Word Embeddings for Capturing Word Similarities Distributed language representation has become the most widely used technique for language representation in various natural language processing tasks . Most of the natural language processing models that are based on deep learning techniques use already pre-trained distributed word representations , commonly called word embeddings . Determining the most qualitative word embeddings is of crucial importance for such models . However , selecting the appropriate word embeddings is a perplexing task since the projected embedding space is not intuitive to humans . In this paper , we explore different approaches for creating distributed word representations . We perform an intrinsic evaluation of several state-of-the-art word embedding methods . Their performance on capturing word similarities is analysed with existing benchmark datasets for word pairs similarities . The research in this paper conducts a correlation analysis between ground truth word similarities and similarities obtained by different word embedding methods .","the doctorate back to the FON for new deliberation , giving them 60 days to do so .

"ReSet : Learning Recurrent Dynamic Routing in ResNet-like Neural Networks Neural Network is a powerful Machine Learning tool that shows outstanding performance in Computer Vision , Natural Language Processing , and Artificial Intelligence . In particular , recently proposed ResNet architecture and its modifications produce state-of-the-art results in image classification problems . ResNet and most of the previously proposed architectures have a fixed structure and apply the same transformation to all input images . In this work , we develop a ResNet-based model that dynamically selects Computational Units ( CU ) for each input object from a learned set of transformations . Dynamic selection allows the network to learn a sequence of useful transformations and apply only required units to predict the image label . We compare our model to ResNet-38 architecture and achieve better results than the original ResNet on CIFAR-10.1 test set . While examining the produced paths , we discovered that the network learned different routes for images from different classes and similar routes for similar images .","as it stemmed from an earlier tune `` We Will Overcome '' .

As a result , we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification , sequence generation , and speech generation within a single , unified prompting framework . The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters .

Many have called for a reevaluation of higher learning away from a focus on grades and credentials towards a more holistic approach .

This updated focus has culminated in the creation of sites such as Eli Review which is intended to facilitate improved writing through peer review . Educators have recognized the need for careful consideration when implementing plagiarism detection software in order to balance the promotion of academic integrity with maintaining a positive learning environment . This balancing act has been at the center of the pushback against traditional plagiarism detection systems , as educators have become increasingly aware of the potential negative impact of such technology on trust and privacy .

For some students , there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty , and their decision is that : `` It is not that we love honesty less , but that we love success more . '' Conversely , other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world , this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal , if it ever really had any . However , it has been shown that the expected benefits of cheating as well as student 's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior . There have been studies that have looked into success and academic dishonesty ; one study showed that students given an unexpected opportunity to cheat did not improve their grades significantly from the control group . Another study showed that students who were allowed to bring cheat sheets to a test did not improve their grades . While this may conflict with the common perception of cheating ( one survey found that only 13",0

"page paper . Without a rigorous standard that defines plagiarism , instructors defining plagiarism based on their own understanding can lead to confusion and conflicts . === Plagiarism education === Though widely employed in high schools and universities , plagiarism detection tools create a delicate environment in the classroom , as they place instructors in the role of guardians of ethical principles , establishing an adversarial relationship between teachers and students . These tools presuppose that students are prone to plagiarizing and that instructors should use advanced techniques to uncover it . Such scrutiny can cause students to feel afraid and disempowered , as they may consider these tools as omnipotent monitors . The WriteCheck reviews demonstrate that students may be afraid of being caught , leading to writing with pressure and anxiety . These reviews highlight the power dynamics and the culture of fear around plagiarism in the classroom . Additionally , inherent power imbalances between instructors and students exist since students may feel obligated to submit their work to Turnitin for evaluation . Furthermore , Turnitin endeavors to promote Western writing values globally . It inherently promotes standardized writing around the world , advancing Western ideas of authorship","Senate 's decision .

Popović asked for some time over the summer to see into the students ' demands , so the students set a deadline for September , when they promised to continue their actions . On 13 September 2019 , a group of students from the association `` 1 of 5 Million '' locked themselves inside the Rectorate , blocking anyone from entering .

The `` angry young man '' films of Amitabh Bachchan and Salim–Javed were popular during the 1970s and 1980s before Bollywood 's popularity began gradually declining in the 1980s and 1990s . It experienced an Indonesian revival with the release of Shah Rukh Khan 's Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ( 1998 ) in 2001 , which was a bigger box-office success in the country than Titanic ( 1997 ) . Bollywood has had a strong presence in Indonesia since then , particularly Shah Rukh Khan films such as Mohabbatein ( 2000 ) , Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ( 2001 ) , Kal Ho Naa Ho , Chalte Chalte and Koi ... Mil Gaya ( all 2003 ) , and Veer-Zaara ( 2004 ) . ==== East Asia ==== Some Bollywood films have been widely appreciated in China , Japan , and South Korea . Several Hindi films have been commercially successful in Japan , including Mehboob Khan 's Aan ( 1952 , starring Dilip Kumar ) and Aziz Mirza 's Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman ( 1992 , starring Shah Rukh Khan ) . The latter sparked a two-year boom in Indian films after its 1997 release ,",". In 2022 , Hindi cinema represented 33 % of box office revenue , followed by Telugu and Tamil representing 20 % and 16 % respectively . Mumbai is one of the largest centres for film production in the world . Hindi films sold an estimated 341 million tickets in India in 2019 . Earlier Hindi films tended to use vernacular Hindustani , mutually intelligible by speakers of either Hindi or Urdu , while modern Hindi productions increasingly incorporate elements of Hinglish . The most popular commercial genre in Hindi cinema since the 1970s has been the masala film , which freely mixes different genres including action , comedy , romance , drama and melodrama along with musical numbers . Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre , of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry 's total musical output after musical films declined in the West . The first Indian talkie , Alam Ara ( 1931 ) , was produced in the Hindustani language , four years after Hollywood 's first sound film , The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) .

In many fields of scientific research , productivity and success is measured by the number of publications and related metrics such as impact factor and reputation of the journal an article is published in . Career pressure – Science is a very strongly career-driven discipline . Scientists depend on their record of achievement to receive ongoing support and funding , and a good reputation relies largely on the publication of high-profile scientific papers . Hence , there is a strong imperative to `` publish or perish '' . This pressure is stronger in some research settings than others , contributing to the increased prevalence of misconduct in some parts of the world than others . This may motivate desperate ( or fame-hungry ) scientists to fabricate results . Ease of fabrication – In","the people and cultures of those locales . Contrary to these spaces and geographies being filmed as they are , they are actually Indianised by adding Bollywood actors and Hindi speaking extras to them . While immersing in Bollywood films , viewers get to see their local experiences duplicated in different locations around the world . According to Shakuntala Rao , `` Media representation can depict India 's shifting relation with the world economy , but must retain its 'Indianness ' in moments of dynamic hybridity '' ; `` Indianness '' ( cultural identity ) poses a problem with Bollywood 's popularity among varied diaspora audiences , but gives its domestic audience a sense of uniqueness from other immigrant groups . == Awards == The Filmfare Awards are some of the most prominent awards given to Hindi films in India . The Indian screen magazine Filmfare began the awards in 1954 ( recognising the best films of 1953 ) , and they were originally known as the Clare Awards after the magazine 's editor .

Trump 's speech was leaked hours in advance by Correct the Record , a liberal-leaning Super PAC , though Trump had already given copies of his speech to the network press pool . Trump 's daughter , Ivanka Trump , introduced Trump in a speech immediately before his own speech . `` Here Comes the Sun '' was used as the entrance music for Ivanka Trump . The George Harrison estate complained about the use of this song , which his family said was `` offensive and against the wishes of the George Harrison estate .

A Gallup survey found that 35 % of Americans saw Trump 's speech positively ( either `` excellent '' or `` good '' ) , while 36 % saw it negatively . According to Gallup , the speech had `` the least positive reviews of any speech we have tested after the fact .

After several disciplinary commissions , where Danica Popović was the first professor to report the student , it was proved that Jakšić accused her of selling exams on one of the faculties public discussions ( he said it was an `` open secret '' ) . His defense was that he has the right to say things even without any proof or witnesses , cause his oppionion is not the claim ( `` You ca n't do anything to me '' ) . He found no witness to support him at the commission , while Popović 's witnesses , other professors and academics , Jakšić called out for the lack of credibility . He was supported by president Vučić who said that Popović is `` the professor who is harassing the student who stood up to her at her class '' . The commission gave the sanction of strict reprimand to Jakšić , while Popović asked for him to be sacked from the faculty .

The papers reported to be plagiarised are 'The connectivity of squares of box graphs ' , 'On edge-connectivity of inserted graphs ' and 'Factors of inserted graphs ' . The reviews may be found in MathSciNet . The original work was carried out by T Zamfirescu 's in the 1970s . An investigation by Calcutta university found these to be true and the university is planning action against the concerned . Prof. M.R . Adhikari for his part has shifted the entire blame on the research scholar Lakshmikanto Pramanik who had `` used his name without consent '' .

"tradition of poetry about the loves of Krishna , Radha , and the gopis . Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists , and the lyricist and composer may be seen as a team . This phenomenon has been compared to the pairs of American composers and songwriters who created classic Broadway musicals . Before 2008 , Bollywood scripts were often handwritten because , in the industry , there is a perception that manual writing is the quickest way to create scripts . == Sound == Sound in early Bollywood films was usually not recorded on location ( sync sound ) . It was usually created ( or re-created ) in the studio , with the actors speaking their lines in the studio and sound effects added later ; this created synchronisation problems . Commercial Indian films are known for their lack of ambient sound , and the Arriflex 3 camera necessitated dubbing . Lagaan ( 2001 ) was filmed with sync sound , and several Bollywood films have recorded on-location sound since then . == Female makeup artists == In 1955 , the Bollywood Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers ' Association ( CCMAA ) ruled that","the view that Guttenberg had continued his dissertation despite the feeling of being overburdened , denied negligence and concluded on intention . == Reactions == === Criticism by Walter Schmitt Glaeser === The University of Bayreuth 's handling of the matter was sharply criticized by its former vice-president and law professor Walter Schmitt Glaeser , who , while agreeing that rescinding the doctoral degree was justified , described the additional measures taken by the institution as a battue ( Treibjagd ) . As any affiliation of Guttenberg to the university was severed by the rescinding of his degree , the university therefore lacked legal standing for any further investigation , Glaeser argued . The leaking of information from the commission 's confidential meetings to the press – according to Glaeser most-likely done by its members – he called `` outrageous '' and `` more than embarrassing '' . For Glaeser especially the part of the report looking into a possible deception by Guttenberg should not have been published . Also , according to Glaeser , the fact that Guttenberg had to agree to the report 's publication due to massive public pressure , including from University of Bayreuth , cast",0

"February 2011 , Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment , transacting ₿9.9 million , worth about $ 214 million . === 2013–2014 : First regulatory actions === In March 2013 , the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ( FinCEN ) established regulatory guidelines for `` decentralized virtual currencies '' such as bitcoin , classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as money services businesses , subject to registration and other legal obligations . In May 2013 , US authorities seized the unregistered exchange Mt . Gox . In June 2013 , the US Drug Enforcement Administration seized ₿11.02 from an individual attempting to use them to purchase illicit drugs . This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoins . The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from Silk Road , following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht . In December 2013 , the People 's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoin .

In 2001 , the Central Bureau of Investigation seized all prints of Chori Chori Chupke Chupke after the film was found to be funded by members of the Mumbai underworld . Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread copyright infringement of its films . Often , bootleg DVD copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas . Manufacturing of bootleg DVD , VCD , and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and southeast Asia . The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI ) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $ 100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs . In addition to the homegrown market , demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the Indian diaspora . Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies , since the Pakistani government has banned their sale , distribution and telecast .

Race , nationality , and class all show little correlation with academic misconduct . There is also no correlation between how religious someone is and the likelihood that the person will cheat .

She wrote the popular book Heidi . Born in Hirzel , a rural area in the canton of Zürich , as a child she spent several summers near Chur in Graubünden , the setting she later would use in her novels . == Biography == Spyri is the daughter of poet Meta Heusser-Schweizer . In 1852 , Johanna Heusser married a lawyer named Bernhard Spyri . Whilst living in the city of Zürich she began to write about life in the country . Her first story , `` A Leaf on Vrony 's Grave '' , which deals with a woman 's life of domestic violence , was published in 1873 ; the following years further stories for both adults and children appeared , among them the novel Heidi , which she wrote in just four weeks . Heidi tells the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps , and is famous for its vivid","and action films about gangsters ( the Bombay underworld ) and bandits ( dacoits ) . Salim-Javed 's writing and Amitabh Bachchan 's acting popularised the trend with films such as Zanjeer and ( particularly ) Deewaar , a crime film inspired by Gunga Jumna which pitted `` a policeman against his brother , a gang leader based on real-life smuggler Haji Mastan '' ( Bachchan ) ; according to Danny Boyle , Deewaar was `` absolutely key to Indian cinema '' . In addition to Bachchan , several other actors followed by riding the crest of the trend ( which lasted into the early 1990s ) . Actresses from the era include Hema Malini , Jaya Bachchan , Raakhee , Shabana Azmi , Zeenat Aman , Parveen Babi , Rekha , Dimple Kapadia , Smita Patil , Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapure . The name `` Bollywood '' was coined during the 1970s , when the conventions of commercial Hindi films were defined . Key to this was the masala film , which combines a number of genres ( action , comedy , romance , drama , melodrama , and musical ) . The masala film was pioneered early",0

"of academic misconduct . Peer pressure works both ways , as a study found that there is a 41 % increase in the probability of a student cheating if they have seen someone else cheat . However , even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating , there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure . For instance , larger schools , which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools , tend to have a weaker community , being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other . Another measure of a college community , how many students live on campus , further shows a significant relation with a school 's cheating rate . Relatedly , many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior . === Ethical causes === No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior , before they can cheat they must overcome their own conscience . This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape","Regulation in Science == After an announcement on 6 May 2011 , already citing the conclusions , the university released the report to the public on 11 May 2011 .

These included institutional enhancements , the evaluation of academic misconduct corresponding to standards of scientific community . The report then defined the criteria of academic misconduct : deliberately or grossly negligent use of misrepresentations ( Falschangaben ) , the violation of intellectual property of others , and the obstruction of research . The term Falschangabe was defined as the fabrication or distortion of data and the `` obstruction of research '' was defined as unauthorized use of material with arrogation of its authorship .

It was reported that Trump campaign aides and RNC staff worked on the floor to persuade delegates to withdraw their support and `` challenged the validity of various signatures .

"in their classroom . Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work . === Demographic and personal causes === Research has identified a number of demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating , including age , gender and grade point average . Older students , females , and students with higher academic achievement are less likely to cheat , whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so . Students involved in extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies , or may have more demands on their time , which interfere with their studies , creating a greater incentive to cheat . It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat : one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college . Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development , one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and their likelihood of cheating ( that is , students at a pre-conventional stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a post-conventional","reliably , stylometry can help in identifying disguised and paraphrased plagiarism . Stylometric comparisons are likely to fail in cases where segments are strongly paraphrased to the point where they more closely resemble the personal writing style of the plagiarist or if a text was compiled by multiple authors . The results of the International Competitions on Plagiarism Detection held in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , as well as experiments performed by Stein , indicate that stylometric analysis seems to work reliably only for document lengths of several thousand or tens of thousands of words , which limits the applicability of the method to computer-assisted plagiarism detection settings . An increasing amount of research is performed on methods and systems capable of detecting translated plagiarism . Currently , cross-language plagiarism detection ( CLPD ) is not viewed as a mature technology and respective systems have not been able to achieve satisfying detection results in practice . Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches , because it is independent of textual characteristics .

Karapandža claimed at the time that Mali plagiarized at least 33 % of the thesis ,","Mali as the chairman of the Board of Directors of Komercijalna banka in 2013 , refused to buy the software sold by the Center for Innovation and Finance ( CIF ) , a company where Karapandža was one of the shareholders and was inventor of the software . One year after Mali refused to buy the software , Karapandža posted that his PhD was plagiarism . Karapandža gave the exact data when CIF was actually invited to a tender by the bank . It was in 2009 and 2017 , while Mali was board member from 2013 to 2014 , which can be confirmed by the board members from the EBRD . He added that Mali is doctor as much as Dr. Dre or Dr Nele Karajlić . Dejan Šoškić , former governor of the National Bank of Serbia , also refuted the claim . Karapandža and Šoškić were then accused of `` wasting '' another bank , Srpska Banka . Additionally , Karapandža was accused of falsifying report on his plagiarism from his university . Karapandža was also accused of `` robbing '' and racketeering other banks and being a member of the `` mafia octopus '' . Karapandža",0

The basic argument is that materials must be added to a database in order for the TMS to effectively determine a match , but adding users ' materials to such a database may infringe on their intellectual property rights . The issue has been raised in a number of court cases . An additional complication with the use of TMS is that the software finds only precise matches to other text . It does not pick up poorly paraphrased work , for example , or the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software , which is known as rogeting . It also can not evaluate whether the paraphrase genuinely reflects an original understanding or is an attempt to bypass detection . Another complication with TMS is its tendency to flag much more content than necessary , including legitimate citations and paraphrasing , making it difficult to find real cases of plagiarism . This issue arises because TMS algorithms mainly look at surface-level text similarities without considering the context of the writing . Educators have raised concerns that reliance on TMS may shift focus away from teaching proper citation",0

", people who engage in neutralization support the societal norm in question , but `` conjure up '' reasons why they are allowed to violate that norm in a particular case . Neutralization is not a simple case of ex post facto rationalization , but is rather a more comprehensive affair , occurring before , during , and after the act of cheating . Researchers have found four major types of neutralization of academic dishonesty , which they categorize by type of justification . Denial of responsibility – that is , the accusation that others are to blame or that something forced the student to cheat – is the most common form of neutralization among college students who cheated , with 61 % of cheaters using this form of justification . Condemnation of condemner – that is , that the professors are hypocrites or brought it on themselves – is the second most common form of college student neutralization at 28 % . The third most popular form of neutralization among college students is the appeal to higher loyalties , where the student thinks their responsibility to some other entity , usually their peers , is more important than doing","by the case of professor Aleksandar Jakšić .

Students are not the only ones to cheat in an academic setting . A study among North Carolina school teachers found that 35 percent of respondents said they had witnessed their colleagues cheating in one form or another . The rise of high-stakes testing and the consequences of the results on the teacher is cited as a reason why a teacher might want to inflate the results of their students . The first scholarly studies in the 1960s of academic dishonesty in higher education found that nationally in the U.S. , somewhere between 50 and 70 percent of college students had cheated at least once . While nationally , these rates of cheating in the U.S. remain stable today , there are large disparities between different schools , depending on the size , selectivity , and anti-cheating policies of the school . Generally , the smaller and more selective the college , the less cheating occurs there . For instance , the number of students who have engaged in academic dishonesty at",0

This study also found that different versions of tests are used comparatively infrequently in examinations , for example by trying to ensure sufficient distance between students or by ensuring that enough supervisors are present . According to a manual for professors on cheating , Similarly , a survey found that university teachers were less likely to engage in different methods of preventing and detecting academic dishonesty if they rated perceived effort as too high , perceived effectiveness as too low , external expectations that such behaviour should be enforced as too low , or if they did not strongly disapprove of academic dishonesty . Such reasons have been also observed in other studies . There are other reasons as well .

Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors ' views on cheating ; the standard objection being that `` students from certain Middle Eastern , Asian , and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can 'own ' ideas , since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property '' . Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job . The argument that `` they 're professors , not policemen '' is often heard in academia . In economic terms , some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning , and if the student loses that learning through cheating , they are only cheating themselves out of the money they have paid for their education . == See also == == References == == External links == Max A.

If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet , it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings . Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the film . A song may be worked into the plot , so a character has a reason to sing . It may externalise a character 's thoughts , or presage an event in the film ( such as two characters falling in love ) . The songs are often referred to as a `` dream sequence '' , with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world . Song and dance scenes were often filmed in Kashmir but , due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s , they have been shot in western Europe ( particularly Switzerland and Austria ) .

Johnson initially expressed interest in hiring the young intern as his Oval Office assistant , but after an article by Kearns appeared in The New Republic laying out a scenario for Johnson 's removal from office over his conduct of the war in Vietnam , she was , instead , assigned to the Department of Labor ; Goodwin has written that she felt relieved to be able to remain in the internship program in any capacity at all . `` The president discovered that I had been actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and had written an article entitled , 'How to Dump Lyndon Johnson ' .

Methods of secretly signalling the right answer to friends are quite varied , ranging from coded sneezes or pencil tapping to high-pitched noises beyond the hearing range of most teachers . Some students have been known to use more elaborate means , such as using a system of repetitive body signals like hand movements or foot jerking to distribute answers ( i.e . where a tap of the foot could correspond to answer `` A '' , two taps for answer `` B '' , and so on ) . One other method is taking advantage of time zones , particularly in exams administered worldwide . Those who take the exam first ( likely in Oceania ) can then post answers for those about to take the exam ( in a time zone behind like Europe ) . === Impersonation === Impersonation is a form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it .

The writer Thomas Mallon noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature ( Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Reade being two notable examples ) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to kleptomania ( a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing , even when it is against the interests of the thief ) . On the other hand , Mallon concludes it is probable that most `` cheaters '' make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct . A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to `` gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power '' . Richard Fass puts forward the possibility that business scandals in the real world make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society . Academic dishonesty , in this case , would be practice for the real world . For some students , there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty , and their decision is that : `` It is not that we love",0

The database community is becoming increasingly interested in temporal database systems , that are intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only about the present , but also about the past and future . When interfacing to temporal databases , supporting temporal linguistic mechanisms becomes crucial .

The framework consists of a temporal intermediate representation language , called TOP , an HPSG grammar that maps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP expressions , and a provably correct method for translating from TOP to TSQL2 , TSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database language .",0

"Beyond Volume : The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine Learning Pipeline From medical charts to national census , healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm . However , the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age . Ranging from electronic health records , to digitized imaging and laboratory reports , to public health datasets , today , healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information . Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration . Unfortunately , the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models . Rather , a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success . While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records , it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data .

However , existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement . This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex , which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth . Unlike previous approaches , Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM 's context . Instead , it combines the LLM 's action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) Critic , which is trained on past experiences through an offline `` retrospection '' process . Additionally , Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment . We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld , ALFWorld and Webshop environments , demonstrating its advantages over strong , contemporary baselines .",0

"Explanatory machine learning for sequential human teaching The topic of comprehensibility of machine-learned theories has recently drawn increasing attention . Inductive Logic Programming ( ILP ) uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques . Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge . In earlier work , the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks . In a later study , it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning . We continue our investigation of comprehensibility by examining the effects of the ordering of concept presentations on human comprehension . In this work , we examine the explanatory effects of curriculum order and the presence of machine-learned explanations for sequential problem-solving .

In 1964 , Ambrose was commissioned to write the official biography of the former president and five-star general Dwight D. Eisenhower .

Many have called for a reevaluation of higher learning away from a focus on grades and credentials towards a more holistic approach . One such recommendation outlined by scholars is to turn students towards revision as opposed to plagiarism detection . This updated focus has culminated in the creation of sites such as Eli Review which is intended to facilitate improved writing through peer review . Educators have recognized the need for careful consideration when implementing plagiarism detection software in order to balance the promotion of academic integrity with maintaining a positive learning environment . This balancing act has been at the center of the pushback against traditional plagiarism detection systems , as educators have become increasingly aware of the potential negative impact of such technology on trust and privacy . This emphasis on striking a balance between these competing interests highlights the importance of thoughtful and nuanced approaches to addressing plagiarism in the academic context . Not all cultures and countries hold the same beliefs about personal ownership of language or ideas . In some",0

Vikram Bhatt , director of Raaz ( a remake of What Lies Beneath ) and Kasoor ( a remake of Jagged Edge ) , has spoken about the influence of American culture and Bollywood 's desire to produce box-office hits based along the same lines : `` Financially , I would be more secure knowing that a particular piece of work has already done well at the box office . Copying is endemic everywhere in India . Our TV shows are adaptations of American programmes . We want their films , their cars , their planes , their Diet Cokes and also their attitude . The American way of life is creeping into our culture . '' According to Mahesh Bhatt , `` If you hide the source , you 're a genius . There 's no such thing as originality in the creative sphere '' .

"article to the other . And , in truth , I lift them . '' She refers to her own practice of converting `` a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section '' for a different audience . Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism . She also states `` Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases , copyright law 's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works . '' == In other contexts == === Organizational publications === Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people . For example , the American Historical Association 's `` Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct '' ( 2005 ) regarding textbooks and reference books stated that , because textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars ' work , they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater `` extent of","of the research process in other ways . '' The consequences of scientific misconduct can be damaging for perpetrators and journal audiences and for any individual who exposes it . In addition there are public health implications attached to the promotion of medical or other interventions based on false or fabricated research findings . Scientific misconduct can result in loss of public trust in the integrity of science . Three percent of the 3,475 research institutions that report to the US Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Research Integrity ( ORI ) indicate some form of scientific misconduct . However the ORI will only investigate allegations of impropriety where research was funded by federal grants . They routinely monitor such research publications for red flags and their investigation is subject to a statute of limitations . Other private organizations like the Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( COJE ) can only police their own members . A 2025 study from Northwestern University found that `` the publication of fraudulent science is outpacing the growth rate of legitimate scientific publications '' . The study also discovered broad networks of organized scientific fraudsters . == Forms == The U.S.",0

Commenting on these findings , Agricola emphasized that `` fraudulent publishing undermines trust in science and scientific results and therefore fuels antiscience movements '' . == Notable cases == In 1998 Andrew Wakefield published a fraudulent research paper in The Lancet claiming links between the MMR vaccine , autism , and inflammatory bowel disease . In 2010 , he was found guilty of dishonesty in his research and banned from medicine by the UK General","proceedings ( Dixon v. Alabama Board of Education , 1961 ) . === Modified honor codes === Recently , Donald L. McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino , two experts in the field of academic dishonesty , have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland . Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process , making it clear that it is the students ' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves , but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight . The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools . According to supporters of this system , schools with a large student body , a weak college community , or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code . However , while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct , research",0

Metrics are simple to calculate and can be compared quickly , but can also lead to false positives : two fragments with the same scores on a set of metrics may do entirely different things . Hybrid approaches – for instance , parse trees + suffix trees can combine the detection capability of parse trees with the speed afforded by suffix trees , a type of string-matching data structure . The previous classification was developed for code refactoring , and not for academic plagiarism detection ( an important goal of refactoring is to avoid duplicate code , referred to as code clones in the literature ) . The above approaches are effective against different levels of similarity ; low-level similarity refers to identical text , while high-level similarity can be due to similar specifications . In an academic setting , when all students are expected to code to the same specifications , functionally equivalent code ( with high-level similarity ) is entirely expected , and",0
", on which two articles were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and one article in Annals of Internal Medicine , could not be successfully replicated by other scientists . Alfred Steinschneider ( US ) , a medical doctor formerly based at Upstate Medical University , in 1972 developed the theory , published in the journal Pediatrics that SIDS was caused by prolonged sleep apnea , although none of his research or research conducted subsequently by others supported the theory . The case-study upon which Steinschneider 's theory was based was later revealed to involve infanticide committed by the mother , with Steinschneider allegedly having ignored evidence and reports that the children were being abused . In 1997 the editor of Pediatrics , Jerold Lucey , stated that Steinschneider 's original paper on the subject was `` seriously flawed '' and should not have been published . Marc Straus ( US ) , former Chief of Oncology and Associate Professor of Medicine at Boston University Medical Center , in 1982 admitted to `` serious deficiencies '' , including the use of false data , in research studies he supervised . He also admitted to using ineligible","in any current statute , either criminal or civil . Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights . In short , people are asked to use the guideline , `` if you did not write it yourself ; you must give credit '' . Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement . Although both terms may apply to a particular act , they are different concepts , and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright . Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder , when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent . Plagiarism , in contrast , is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author 's reputation , or the obtaining of academic credit , that is achieved through false claims of authorship . Thus , plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist 's audience ( for example , a reader , listener , or teacher ) . Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in",0
"the following years further stories for both adults and children appeared , among them the novel Heidi , which she wrote in just four weeks . Heidi tells the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps , and is famous for its vivid portrayal of the landscape . Spyri 's husband and her only child , both named Bernhard , both died in 1884 . Alone , she devoted herself to charitable causes and wrote over fifty more stories before her death in 1901 . She was interred in the family plot at the Sihlfeld-A Cemetery in Zürich . An icon in Switzerland , Spyri 's portrait was placed on a postage stamp in 1951 and on a 20 CHF commemorative coin in 2009 . Among her present-day relatives is Swiss artist and curator Andreas Heusser . == Plagiarism claim == In April 2010 a professor searching for children 's illustrations found a book written in 1830 by a German history teacher , Hermann Adam von Kamp , that Spyri may have used as a basis for Heidi .

Stefanović stated at the time that the UST will follow guidelines of the MEDEL , European association of judges and public prosecutors . However , already in November 2018 , the MEDEL warned that the UST is actually a GONGO , formed by the government to confirm and justify opinions and visions of government officials . Colleagues of professor Sinani from the Faculty of Philosophy called the prosecutor 's office unprofessional , stating that Marić 's behavior was n't just shameful but against the Constitution and its Article 21 .

"achieve satisfying detection results in practice . Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches , because it is independent of textual characteristics . However , since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information , it is limited to academic texts . It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages , which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism ; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources . ==== Software ==== The design of content similarity detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors : Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large , internal databases ( in addition to other resources ) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis .

It has been argued that by plagiarizing , students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades . Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize . When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable , plagiarism was less likely to occur .

In many countries ( with the notable exception of the United States ) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct . Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner , or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation . Well publicised cases illustrate the potential role that senior academics in research institutions play in concealing scientific misconduct . A King 's College ( London ) internal investigation showed research findings from one of their researchers to be 'at best unreliable , and in many cases spurious ' but the college took no action , such as retracting relevant published research or preventing further episodes from occurring .

In contrast , others have proposed that `` the essay is dead '' , declaring that artificial intelligence will transform academia and society . One scholar of plagiarism , Eaton , proposed the idea of a postplagiarism era , in which human and artificial-intelligence hybrid writing become normal . The impact of artificial intelligence on plagiarism has yet to be fully understood , but LLMs have triggered a huge wave of content automation and this poses a risk of saturation of the internet . A 2024 study from researchers in Singapore shows how this misuse of artificial intelligence for automated content creation at scale could lead to a 'Plagiarism Singularity ' in the near future , where most original work would also be marked as plagiarised due to a massive amount of artificially generated content on the internet .

A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection . Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold . Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting , which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection , such as the Internet . ===== String matching ===== String matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science . When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection , documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps . Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task , of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection . Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise . Generally , suffix document models , such as suffix trees or suffix vectors , have been used for this task . Nonetheless ,",0

Bollywood action scenes emulated Hong Kong rather than Hollywood , emphasising acrobatics and stunts and combining kung fu ( as perceived by Indians ) with Indian martial arts such as pehlwani . == Influence of Hindi cinema == === India === Perhaps Hindi cinema 's greatest influence has been on India 's national identity , where ( with the rest of Indian cinema ) it has become part of the `` Indian story '' . In India , Bollywood is often associated with India 's national identity .

"be less popular at the box office . A large Indian diaspora in English-speaking countries and increased Western influence in India have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood . According to film critic Lata Khubchandani , `` Our earliest films ... had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them . Strangely , it was after Independence [ that ] the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures . '' Although Bollywood plots feature Westernised urbanites dating and dancing in clubs rather than pre-arranged marriages , traditional Indian culture continues to exist outside the industry and is an element of resistance by some to Western influences . Bollywood plays a major role , however , in Indian fashion . Studies have indicated that some people , unaware that changing fashion in Bollywood films is often influenced by globalisation , consider the clothes worn by Bollywood actors as authentically Indian . == Casts and crews == == Scripts , dialogues , and lyrics == Film scripts ( known as dialogues in Indian English ) and their song lyrics are often written by different people . Earlier , scripts were usually written in an unadorned Hindustani ,","Comparative Analysis of Word Embeddings for Capturing Word Similarities Distributed language representation has become the most widely used technique for language representation in various natural language processing tasks . Most of the natural language processing models that are based on deep learning techniques use already pre-trained distributed word representations , commonly called word embeddings . Determining the most qualitative word embeddings is of crucial importance for such models . However , selecting the appropriate word embeddings is a perplexing task since the projected embedding space is not intuitive to humans . In this paper , we explore different approaches for creating distributed word representations . We perform an intrinsic evaluation of several state-of-the-art word embedding methods . Their performance on capturing word similarities is analysed with existing benchmark datasets for word pairs similarities . The research in this paper conducts a correlation analysis between ground truth word similarities and similarities obtained by different word embedding methods .",0

A suspicious document is checked for plagiarism by computing its fingerprint and querying minutiae with a precomputed index of fingerprints for all documents of a reference collection . Minutiae matching with those of other documents indicate shared text segments and suggest potential plagiarism if they exceed a chosen similarity threshold . Computational resources and time are limiting factors to fingerprinting , which is why this method typically only compares a subset of minutiae to speed up the computation and allow for checks in very large collection , such as the Internet . ===== String matching ===== String matching is a prevalent approach used in computer science . When applied to the problem of plagiarism detection , documents are compared for verbatim text overlaps . Numerous methods have been proposed to tackle this task , of which some have been adapted to external plagiarism detection . Checking a suspicious document in this setting requires the computation and storage of efficiently comparable representations for all documents in the reference collection to compare them pairwise . Generally , suffix document models , such as suffix trees or suffix vectors , have been used for this task . Nonetheless ,",0
"achieve satisfying detection results in practice . Citation-based plagiarism detection using citation pattern analysis is capable of identifying stronger paraphrases and translations with higher success rates when compared to other detection approaches , because it is independent of textual characteristics . However , since citation-pattern analysis depends on the availability of sufficient citation information , it is limited to academic texts . It remains inferior to text-based approaches in detecting shorter plagiarized passages , which are typical for cases of copy-and-paste or shake-and-paste plagiarism ; the latter refers to mixing slightly altered fragments from different sources . ==== Software ==== The design of content similarity detection software for use with text documents is characterized by a number of factors : Most large-scale plagiarism detection systems use large , internal databases ( in addition to other resources ) that grow with each additional document submitted for analysis . However , this feature is considered by some as a violation of student copyright . === In source code === Plagiarism in computer source code is also frequent , and requires different tools than those used for text comparisons in document . Significant research has been dedicated to academic source-code plagiarism . A","several students up and consulting with one another , he decided that they were not cheating , but were using non-traditional techniques and collaborative learning to surmount the obstacles teachers had put in their way . Issues of cultural relativism also affect professors ' views on cheating ; the standard objection being that `` students from certain Middle Eastern , Asian , and African cultures are baffled by the notion that one can 'own ' ideas , since their cultures regard words and ideas as the property of all rather than as individual property '' . Another issue teachers may have with deterring cheating is that they may decide that it is not their job . The argument that `` they 're professors , not policemen '' is often heard in academia . In economic terms , some professors believe they are being paid to provide learning , and if the student loses that learning through cheating , they are only cheating themselves out of the money they have paid for their education . == See also == == References == == External links == Max A.

"publish or perish '' . This pressure is stronger in some research settings than others , contributing to the increased prevalence of misconduct in some parts of the world than others . This may motivate desperate ( or fame-hungry ) scientists to fabricate results . Ease of fabrication – In many scientific fields , results are often difficult to reproduce accurately , being obscured by noise , artifacts , and other extraneous data . That means that even if a scientist does falsify data , they may expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field . There are few strongly backed systems to investigate possible violations , attempt to press charges , or punish deliberate misconduct . It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data .

Organisations such as the India EU Film Initiative seek to foster a community between filmmakers and industry professionals in India and the European Union . A commonly reported justification for plagiarism in Bollywood is that cautious producers want to remake popular Hollywood films in an Indian context . Although screenwriters generally produce original scripts , many are rejected due to uncertainty about whether a film will be successful . Poorly-paid screenwriters have also been criticised for a lack of creativity .

"Time , Tense and Aspect in Natural Language Database Interfaces Most existing natural language database interfaces ( NLDBs ) were designed to be used with database systems that provide very limited facilities for manipulating time-dependent data , and they do not support adequately temporal linguistic mechanisms ( verb tenses , temporal adverbials , temporal subordinate clauses , etc. ) . The database community is becoming increasingly interested in temporal database systems , that are intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only about the present , but also about the past and future . When interfacing to temporal databases , supporting temporal linguistic mechanisms becomes crucial . We present a framework for constructing natural language interfaces for temporal databases ( NLTDBs ) , that draws on research in tense and aspect theories , temporal logics , and temporal databases . The framework consists of a temporal intermediate representation language , called TOP , an HPSG grammar that maps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP expressions , and a provably correct method for translating from TOP to TSQL2 , TSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database language .","committed `` deliberate scientific malpractice '' . In 2017 the University of Copenhagen revoked Penkowa 's doctoral degree . As of 2020 Penkowa has had nine of her research publications retracted , and four others have received an expression of concern . Eric Poehlman ( US ) , a former Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Vermont , was convicted in 2005 of grant fraud after falsifying data in as many as 17 grant applications between 1992 and 2000 . He was the first academic in the United States to be jailed for falsifying data in a grant application . Poehlman has had seven of his publications retracted . Don Poldermans , a researcher at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands . published studies from 1999 until the early 2010s claiming that Beta blocker should be administered before certain surgeries . European medical guidelines ( and to a lesser extent US guidelines ) recommended the practice during the years 2009 to 2013 , guiding millions of surgeries .

"Trump 's speech `` almost immediately came under scrutiny when striking similarities were discovered between her speech '' and Michelle Obama 's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention . The Trump campaign at first denied allegations of plagiarism . Campaign manager Paul Manafort argued that the speech contained `` not that many similarities '' and the words used are not unique words `` that belong to the Obamas . '' Following Trump 's speech , freelance journalist Jarrett Hill was the first to report that the speech had large similarities . Later , Chris Harrick , Vice President of Marketing at the plagiarism prevention service Turnitin , later reported that Trump used about 6 % of Michelle Obama 's words and found two types of plagiarism , `` clone '' and `` find and replace '' . Various media outlets suggested that members of Donald Trump 's presidential campaign should respond to the accusations , which they did a few hours after the speech in the form of the following statement by the campaign 's senior communications advisor , Jason Miller : `` In writing [ the ] speech , Melania 's team of writers took notes on her","as does `` Dreams of Children '' , B-side to `` Going Underground '' , played then as a lead guitar riff . Bassist Bruce Foxton commented on the similarity : We were listening a lot to The Beatles ' Revolver album . It was n't intentional , but 'Taxman ' subconsciously went in and when we came up with the idea for `` Start ! '' that 's what went in . It isn ’ t exactly the same thankfully , otherwise I 'm sure Paul McCartney would have thought about suing us ! Madonna 's 1984 song `` Material Girl '' has similar strophes to Melissa Manchester 's `` You Should Hear How She Talks About You '' , released in 1982 . Despite being highlighted by many observers , there never was official credit given for this interpolation . Rod Stewart 's 1988 single `` Forever Young '' not only has the same title as the 1973 Bob Dylan song of the same name , but similar musical ideas and lyrics . When this was pointed out to Stewart , he agreed to split royalties 50-50 , and Stewart donated his share to charity . In 1997",0
"there are a considerable number of pre-Enlightenment authors who accused others of plagiarism and considered it distasteful and scandalous , including historians Polybius and Pliny the Elder . The 3rd century Greek work Lives of the Eminent Philosophers mentions that Heraclides Ponticus was accused of plagiarizing ( κλέψαντα αὐτὸν ) a treatise on Hesiod and Homer . In Vitruvius 's 7th book , he acknowledged his debt to earlier writers and attributed them , and he also included a strong condemnation of plagiarism : `` Earlier writers deserve our thanks , those , on the contrary , deserve our reproaches , who steal the writings of such men and publish them as their own . Those , who depend in their writings , not on their own ideas , but who enviously do wrong to the works of others and boast of it , deserve not merely to be blamed , but to be sentenced to actual punishment for their wicked course of life .

He recounted a story where the well-read Aristophanes of Byzantium judged a poetry competition and caught most","to the book Sharp Dressed Men by former ZZ Top stage manager David Blayney , who was with the band for 15 years , sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the ZZ Top album Eliminator album as a live-in high-tech music teacher to band members Frank Beard and Billy Gibbons . Despite continued denials by the band , it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson in 1986 , paying him $ 600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song `` Thug '' which appeared on Eliminator . Madonna was successfully sued over her 1986 hit `` Papa Do n't Preach '' by songwriters Donna Weiss and Bruce Robert who received financial compensation after claiming the singer 's hit song was stealing from the 1985 track `` Sugar Do n't Bite '' they made for Sam Harris . Due to similarities to `` The Air That I Breathe '' , a song recorded by The Hollies in 1973 , Radiohead were successfully sued for plagiarism over their 1992 song `` Creep '' . Consequently , songwriters Albert Hammond and Mike Hazlewood are credited as co-writers . Led Zeppelin also paid a settlement to",0

"ALERT-Transformer : Bridging Asynchronous and Synchronous Machine Learning for Real-Time Event-based Spatio-Temporal Data We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models . We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas : ( 1 ) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism , ( 2 ) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate , ( 3 ) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method . These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition .

As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating , students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating ( sometimes even treating it as a game ) , leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race . Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior . It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat , probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered . However , if a professor makes clear that they disapprove of cheating , either in the syllabus , in the first class , or at the beginning of a test , academic dishonesty can drop by 12 % .

"is a political matter '' . In 2018 , the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education ( ENQA ) placed the membership of the National Entity for Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education of Serbia ( NAT ) under supervision . After two years , the ENQA concluded in March 2020 that the NAT remained under the influence of the government , instead of being independent and reduced the NAT 's membership from full to the adjoining member . Government appoints majority of the NAT 's Administrative Board members . Also , if the NAT refuses to give credentials to some school or university , they appeal to the National Council for Higher Education ( NSVO ) , where majority of members are also appointed by the government creating a way of bypassing the accreditation body . While the government downplayed the importance of the ENQA 's decision , some academia members stated that this might mean additional checks of the Serbian students who continue postgraduate education in foreign countries , but also that the demotion of the NAT is `` the price for the tolerance showed by the both private and state universities towards the suspicious","dishonesty or academic fraud , and offenders are subject to academic censure , up to and including expulsion for students and termination of contracts for professors and researchers . Some institutions use plagiarism detection software to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing . However , plagiarism detection software does not always yield accurate results , and there are loopholes in these systems . Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientation , including required writing courses and clearly articulated honor codes . Indeed , there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong . Nevertheless , each year a number of students are brought before their institutions ' disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork . However , the practice of plagiarizing by using sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software , known as Rogeting , has rapidly evolved . `` Rogeting '' is an informal neologism created to describe the act of modifying a published source by substituting synonyms for sufficient words to fool plagiarism detection software , often resulting in the creation of new meaningless phrases through extensive synonym swapping",0
"Plagiarism is the representation of another person 's language , thoughts , ideas , or expressions as one 's own original work . Although precise definitions vary depending on the institution , in many countries and cultures plagiarism is considered a violation of academic integrity and journalistic ethics , as well as of social norms around learning , teaching , research , fairness , respect , and responsibility . As such , a person or entity that is determined to have committed plagiarism is often subject to various punishments or sanctions , such as suspension , expulsion from school or work , fines , imprisonment , and other penalties . Not all cultures and countries hold the same beliefs about personal ownership of language or ideas , and plagiarism is typically not in itself a crime . However , like counterfeiting , fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement , violation of moral rights , or torts .

It spawned a genre of dacoit films , in turn defined by Gunga Jumna ( 1961 ) . Written and produced by Dilip Kumar , Gunga Jumna was a dacoit crime drama about two brothers on opposite sides of the law ( a theme which became common in Indian films during the 1970s ) . Some of the best-known epic films of Hindi cinema were also produced at this time , such as K. Asif 's Mughal-e-Azam ( 1960 ) . Other acclaimed mainstream Hindi filmmakers during this period included Kamal Amrohi and Vijay Bhatt . The three most popular male Indian actors of the 1950s and 1960s were Dilip Kumar , Raj Kapoor , and Dev Anand , each with a unique acting style . Kapoor adopted Charlie Chaplin 's tramp persona ; Anand modeled himself on suave Hollywood stars like Gregory Peck and Cary Grant , and Kumar pioneered a form of method acting which predated Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando",0

Only the supervisors ' omission to ask for the PRS papers cited in the bibliography and the grading with summa cum laude was criticized by the commission . === Guttenberg 's statement === In his final response , Guttenberg once again denied that he had deliberately deceived the university and instead blamed severe `` errors in workmanship '' for the grave deficiencies in his doctoral dissertation . He described a high burden of professional commitments as a result of new political responsibilities during the years of his dissertation , which led to an ad-hoc and sometimes chaotic working-method with long intervals between working","according to data from the World Bank .

Specifically , we reformulate speech processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks . As a result , we can seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification , sequence generation , and speech generation within a single , unified prompting framework . The experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters . The prompting method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting .

"Learning Representations from Dendrograms We propose unsupervised representation learning and feature extraction from dendrograms . The commonly used Minimax distance measures correspond to building a dendrogram with single linkage criterion , with defining specific forms of a level function and a distance function over that . Therefore , we extend this method to arbitrary dendrograms . We develop a generalized framework wherein different distance measures and representations can be inferred from different types of dendrograms , level functions and distance functions . Via an appropriate embedding , we compute a vector-based representation of the inferred distances , in order to enable many numerical machine learning algorithms to employ such distances . Then , to address the model selection problem , we study the aggregation of different dendrogram-based distances respectively in solution space and in representation space in the spirit of deep representations . In the first approach , for example for the clustering problem , we build a graph with positive and negative edge weights according to the consistency of the clustering labels of different objects among different solutions , in the context of ensemble methods . Then , we use an efficient variant of correlation clustering to produce the","form of cheating whereby a different person than the student assigned an assignment or exam completes it . Attending a class or completing an interview on another student 's behalf is also considered impersonation . The academic work is totally 'outsourced ' to another person or organization , usually for pay . ==== Contract cheating ==== Contract cheating , also known as ghostwriting is similar to impersonation in that a student hires a third party to complete work on their behalf . Essay mills fall under this category . While it is believed that contract cheating has significantly increased since 2014 , there are currently no figures to demonstrate this surge . This is a relatively new form of cheating , seemingly gaining traction in the 1940s when an increasing amount of advertisements for ghostwriters could be seen on university campuses and in newspapers . This trend continued to grow into the 1960s and 1970s . According to a study conducted in 2019 , it is estimated that the ghostwriting industry produces a revenue of approximately $ 100 million . === Plagiarism === Plagiarism , as defined in the 1995 Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary , is the `` use",0

"; Western pop and classical-dance numbers are commonly seen side-by-side in the same film . The hero ( or heroine ) often performs with a troupe of supporting dancers . Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films contain unrealistically-quick shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song . If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet , it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings . Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the film . A song may be worked into the plot , so a character has a reason to sing . It may externalise a character 's thoughts , or presage an event in the film ( such as two characters falling in love ) . The songs are often referred to as a `` dream sequence '' , with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world . Song and dance scenes were often filmed in Kashmir but , due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s , they have been shot in western Europe ( particularly Switzerland and Austria ) .

"saw King as an earnest and even gifted student who presented consistent , though evolving , theological identity in his essays , exams and classroom comments .... Although the extent of King 's plagiaries suggest he knew that he was at least skirting academic norms , the extant documents offer no direct evidence in this matter . Thus he may have simply become convinced , on the basis of his grades at Crozer and Boston , that his papers were sufficiently competent to withstand critical scrutiny . Moreover , King 's actions during his early adulthood indicate that he increasingly saw himself as a preacher appropriating theological scholarship rather than as an academic producing such scholarship . On page 340 , it was stated that : King 's faulty citation practices were rooted in the notecards he created while conducted research on Tillich and Wieman . Large sections of the expository chapters are verbatim transcriptions of these notecards in which errors he had made while creating his notes are perpetuated .

Most of the natural language processing models that are based on deep learning techniques use already pre-trained distributed word representations , commonly called word embeddings . Determining the most qualitative word embeddings is of crucial importance for such models . However , selecting the appropriate word embeddings is a perplexing task since the projected embedding space is not intuitive to humans . In this paper , we explore different approaches for creating distributed word representations . We perform an intrinsic evaluation of several state-of-the-art word embedding methods . Their performance on capturing word similarities is analysed with existing benchmark datasets for word pairs similarities . The research in this paper conducts a correlation analysis between ground truth word similarities and similarities obtained by different word embedding methods .",0

The next day in a letter Guttenberg asked the University of Bayreuth to revoke his title ( rather than degree ) , and declared that he had `` lost track of the use of sources over the course of the seven years in which [ he ] worked on the thesis '' , but `` at no point made mistakes by intention '' . Also on 21 February 2011 , chancellor Merkel reiterated her support for Guttenberg and told journalists , I appointed Guttenberg as Minister of Defence . I did not appoint him as an academic assistant or doctor . What is important to me is his work as Minister of Defence and he carries out these duties perfectly .

We show that 1 ) there exist tasks A and B such that learning A before B has a better human comprehension with respect to learning B before A and 2 ) there exist tasks A and B such that the presence of explanations when learning A contributes to improved human comprehension when subsequently learning B . We propose a framework for the effects of sequential teaching on comprehension based on an existing definition of comprehensibility and provide evidence for support from data collected in human trials . Empirical results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity a ) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension and b ) leads to human re-discovery of divide-and-conquer problem-solving strategies , and c ) studying machine-learned explanations allows adaptations of human problem-solving strategy with better performance .",0

We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas : ( 1 ) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism , ( 2 ) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate , ( 3 ) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method . These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition .

Although most early Bombay films were unabashedly escapist , a number of filmmakers tackled tough social issues or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their films . Irani made the first Hindi colour film , Kisan Kanya , in 1937 . The following year , he made a colour version of Mother India .

"much simpler for students to copy and paste information from the internet without crediting the original author . Educational institutions often emphasize the importance of originality , proper citation , and academic integrity to combat plagiarism .

A 2012 survey of U.S. high schools found 32 % of students admitted to copying an assignment from the Internet . === Plagiarism detection === Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing and of citation errors , and providing plagiarism prevention education to students . It has been found that a significant share of university instructors do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software . A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism , although the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected .

Their `` angry young man '' , personified by Amitabh Bachchan , reinterpreted Dilip Kumar 's performance in Gunga Jumna in a contemporary urban context and anguished urban poor . By the mid-1970s , romantic confections had given way to gritty , violent crime films and action films about gangsters ( the Bombay underworld ) and bandits ( dacoits ) . Salim-Javed 's writing and Amitabh Bachchan 's acting popularised the trend with films such as Zanjeer and ( particularly ) Deewaar , a crime film inspired by Gunga Jumna which pitted `` a policeman","in the October 2025 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , the report highlights alarming patterns—such as Clarivate 's 2023 exclusion of mathematics from its Highly Cited Researchers list due to metric gaming—and traces the emergence of systematic fraud in a field previously thought immune to such issues . A follow-up paper , `` How to Fight Fraudulent Publishing in the Mathematical Sciences , '' endorsed by the International Mathematical Union and International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics , offers joint recommendations for researchers , institutions , and funders , including discouraging reliance on raw publication and citation counts , promoting expert peer review over bibliometrics , and using curated databases ( e.g. , zbMATH Open ) to vet journals .

B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign , a student controlled judiciary that hears alleged violations , unproctored examinations , and an obligation for all students help enforce the code . === Mixed judicial boards === However , many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty . This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes . Moreover , many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly . In response to these concerns , in the middle of the twentieth century , many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and",0

"Analysis of Stopping Active Learning based on Stabilizing Predictions Within the natural language processing ( NLP ) community , active learning has been widely investigated and applied in order to alleviate the annotation bottleneck faced by developers of new NLP systems and technologies . This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of stopping active learning based on stabilizing predictions ( SP ) . The analysis has revealed three elements that are central to the success of the SP method : ( 1 ) bounds on Cohen 's Kappa agreement between successively trained models impose bounds on differences in F-measure performance of the models ; ( 2 ) since the stop set does not have to be labeled , it can be made large in practice , helping to guarantee that the results transfer to previously unseen streams of examples at test/application time ; and ( 3 ) good ( low variance ) sample estimates of Kappa between successive models can be obtained . Proofs of relationships between the level of Kappa agreement and the difference in performance between consecutive models are presented . Specifically , if the Kappa agreement between two models exceeds a threshold T ( where $ T",", six groups had filed for permits , but none had been granted .

"SpeechPrompt : Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language models ( LMs ) . This approach offers several advantages . It allows an LM to adapt to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates , thus achieving efficiency in both storage and computation . Additionally , prompting modifies only the LM 's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner . This significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific models . These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served by the LM scales up . Motivated by the strengths of prompting , we are the first to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech processing . Recently , there has been a growing interest in converting speech into discrete units for language modeling . Our pioneer research demonstrates that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified prompting framework . Not only can they serve as class labels , but they also contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech signals","found that he had included borrowed passages throughout his dissertation without citation , and had modified those passages in order to conceal their origin .

One reason the Republican Party scheduled their convention in July was to help avoid a longer , drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012 , which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to Mitt Romney losing the election to Barack Obama . The Democratic Party then followed suit , scheduling their convention in Philadelphia the week after the Republicans ' convention , to provide a quicker response . On May 3 , Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus declared Donald Trump the presumptive nominee after Texas senator Ted Cruz dropped out of the race . The next day , Ohio Governor John Kasich suspended his campaign , effectively making Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee .

"MLRegTest : A Benchmark for the Machine Learning of Regular Languages Synthetic datasets constructed from formal languages allow fine-grained examination of the learning and generalization capabilities of machine learning systems for sequence classification . This article presents a new benchmark for machine learning systems on sequence classification called MLRegTest , which contains training , development , and test sets from 1,800 regular languages . Different kinds of formal languages represent different kinds of long-distance dependencies , and correctly identifying long-distance dependencies in sequences is a known challenge for ML systems to generalize successfully .

This article presents a new benchmark for machine learning systems on sequence classification called MLRegTest , which contains training , development , and test sets from 1,800 regular languages . The logical complexity and choice of literal provides a systematic way to understand different kinds of long-distance dependencies in regular languages , and therefore to understand the capacities of different ML systems to learn such long-distance dependencies . The main conclusion is Different kinds of formal languages represent different kinds of long-distance dependencies , and correctly identifying long-distance dependencies in sequences is a known challenge for ML systems to generalize successfully . MLRegTest : A Benchmark for the Machine Learning of Regular Languages Synthetic datasets constructed from formal languages allow fine-grained examination of the learning and generalization capabilities of machine learning systems for sequence classification .

"into the 1960s and 1970s . According to a study conducted in 2019 , it is estimated that the ghostwriting industry produces a revenue of approximately $ 100 million . === Plagiarism === Plagiarism , as defined in the 1995 Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary , is the `` use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one 's own original work '' . In academia , this can range from borrowing without attribution a particularly apt phrase , to paraphrasing someone else 's original idea without citation , to wholesale contract cheating . Europe developed the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal in the 18th century , while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to `` copy the masters as closely as possible '' and avoid `` unnecessary invention '' . The 18th century new morals were institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia ( including academic science , education , engineering etc . ) and journalism , where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics , subject to sanctions like expulsion and other","than its film .

The science-fiction film Ra.One was made on a budget of ₹ 1.35 billion ( about $ 27 million ) , making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time . Sets , costumes , special effects and cinematography were less than world-class , with some notable exceptions , until the mid-to-late 1990s . As Western films and television are more widely distributed in India , there is increased pressure for Bollywood films to reach the same production levels ( particularly in action and special effects ) . Recent Bollywood films , like Krrish ( 2006 ) , have employed international technicians such as Hong Kong-based action choreographer Tony Ching . The increasing accessibility of professional action and special effects , coupled with rising film budgets , have seen an increase in action and science-fiction films .

In this contribution , we propose a novel approach to identify relevant features of the input data , inspired by methods from the energy landscapes field , developed in the physical sciences . By identifying conserved weights within groups of minima of the loss landscapes , we can identify the drivers of model decision making . Analogues to this idea exist in the molecular sciences , where coordinate invariants or order parameters are employed to identify critical features of a molecule . However , no such approach exists for machine learning loss landscapes . We will demonstrate the applicability of energy landscape methods to machine learning models and give examples , both synthetic and from the real world , for how these methods can help to make models more interpretable .",0

"Explanatory machine learning for sequential human teaching The topic of comprehensibility of machine-learned theories has recently drawn increasing attention . Inductive Logic Programming ( ILP ) uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques . Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge . In earlier work , the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks . In a later study , it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning .

After Eisenhower 's death in 1969 , Ambrose made repeated claims to have had a unique and extraordinarily close relationship with him over the final five years of the former President 's life . In an extensive 1998 interview , before a group of high school students , Ambrose stated that he spent `` a lot of time with Ike , really a lot , hundreds and hundreds of hours '' . Ambrose claimed he interviewed Eisenhower on a wide range of subjects , and that he had been with him `` on a daily basis for a couple years '' before his death `` doing interviews and talking about his life '' . The former president 's diary and telephone records show that the pair met only three times , for a total of less than five hours .

All of the delegates from Iowa , Alaska , Utah and the District of Columbia were recorded and counted for Trump , despite the fact that Trump lost all three contests , and most of the members of those delegations had voted for other candidates . The Alaska delegation challenged the award of votes to Trump by the RNC secretary and the Utah delegation booed when its delegates were awarded to Trump , but was reminded by the RNC chairman that the rules for these two states required the votes to be awarded to whichever candidate was still in the race for the RNC Nomination for President , and that Cruz , Rubio , and the other candidates that had withdrawn from the race had forfeited these delegates based on the RNC nomination rules . == Convention",0

The Economist describes bitcoin as `` a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash , a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks '' . These philosophical ideas initially attracted libertarians and anarchists . === Recognition as a currency and legal status === Money serves three purposes : a store of value , a medium of exchange , and a unit of account . According to The Economist in 2014 , bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange . In 2015 , The Economist noted that bitcoins had three qualities useful in a currency : they are `` hard to earn , limited in supply and easy to verify '' .

"Academic dishonesty , academic misconduct , academic fraud and academic integrity are related concepts that refer to various actions on the part of students that go against the expected norms of a school , university or other learning institution . Definitions of academic misconduct are usually outlined in institutional policies . Therefore , academic dishonesty consists of many different categories of behaviour , as opposed to being a singular concept . == History == Academic dishonesty dates back to the first tests . Scholars note that cheating was prevalent on the Chinese civil service exams thousands of years ago , even when cheating carried the penalty of death for both examinee and examiner . Bribery of examiners was also common , as represented in works such as the Ming-dynasty story collection The Book of Swindles . Standards for citation and referencing began at the end of the 19th century with the emergence of guidance provided by scholarly societies that developed discipline-specific expectations for referencing such as the MLA and the APA . About the same time , scholars began researching issues related to cheating , with some early research dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th centuries","or the promotion of contract cheating services . Because it is predicated upon an expected level of learning and comprehension having been achieved , all associated academic accreditation becomes seriously undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions . For professors and researchers , plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination , along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity . Charges of plagiarism against students and professors are typically heard by internal disciplinary committees , by which students and professors have agreed to be bound . Plagiarism is a common reason for academic research papers to be retracted . Library science is developing approaches to address the issue of plagiarism at institutional levels . Scholars of plagiarism include Rebecca Moore Howard , Susan Blum , Tracey Bretag , and Sarah Elaine Eaton . There is a moral implication to plagiarism in that it takes for granted other people 's time , work , and effort . This deontological scrutiny of plagiarism is important to the debate on the ethics of plagiarism . Doctor Amy Robillard poses the metaphor that `` plagiarism is theft '' , and believes that the ethics of",0

The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff , who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct . Actions to reduce plagiarism include coordinating teaching activities to decrease student load , reducing memorization , increasing individual practical activities , and promoting positive reinforcement over punishment . A student may opt to plagiarize due to a lack of research methods , knowledge of citation practices , or an excessive workload . To eventually reduce plagiarism , students should be educated about the ethical and legal concerns surrounding these tools , and teachers should devise suitable and innovative assignments that require more independent thinking . Many scholars and members of academia have taken a negative position on the use of plagiarism detection technologies arguing that its use promotes a culture of surveillance and conformity in higher education . Many have called for a reevaluation of higher learning away from a focus on grades and credentials towards a more holistic approach . One such recommendation",0

"generally requires the adversary to have access to more mining power than the rest of the network combined . The mining process in bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer processing power . Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks , which are then verified by the network . Each block must contain a proof of work ( PoW ) to be accepted , involving finding a nonce number that , combined with the block content , produces a hash numerically smaller than the network 's difficulty target . This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate , requiring many attempts . PoW forms the basis of bitcoin 's consensus mechanism . The difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target , which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks ( approximately two weeks ) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks . The process requires significant computational power and specialized hardware .

"Towards CRISP-ML ( Q ) : A Machine Learning Process Model with Quality Assurance Methodology Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing . Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations . We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications , that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application . The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project . The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications , as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent . With each task of the process , we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks . The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable . The process","Hobbs never heard back from the publisher . In 2001 , Hobbs came across the lyric book to `` Nikita '' and noticed similarities with his song . Despite repeated attempts by Hobbs to contact John over the issue , he never heard from him , and commenced legal action in 2012 . On 31 October 2012 , a federal judge granted John and Taupin 's motion to dismiss , finding that the song did not infringe Hobbs 's copyright because the only similar elements were generic images and themes that are not protected under copyright law .

Braham alleged that Swift had plagiarized his song `` Haters Gone Hate '' in her 2014 hit `` Shake It Off '' .

Representative of the FON 's students in the NNV , Moma Kovačević , stated that this means Mali has no support of the council anymore . Several council members wanted for the council to vote directly on plagiarism , but this was ignored by the FON 's dean Milija Suknović . Hence , the faculty never actually voted whether the work is plagiarism or not . This did n't stop pro-government media to report that it was again voted that the doctorate is not plagiarism . The report sent to the university 's Ethics Board had more than 699 pages , analyzing the doctoral dissertation . Commission members ( Erić , Čater , Kandžija , Mikerević ) requested a meeting with board members to substantiate their views about the indisputable scientific contribution of Mali 's work .

McCabe and Linda Klebe Trevino , two experts in the field of academic dishonesty , have proposed a new way of deterring cheating that has been implemented in schools such as the University of Maryland . Modified honor codes put students in charge of the judicial hearing process , making it clear that it is the students ' responsibility to stop cheating amongst themselves , but at the same time students still have proctored exams and are not allowed to take pledges of good conduct in place of professor oversight . The researchers who advocate this type of code seem to think that the normal honor code is something of a special case that is not applicable to many schools . According to supporters of this system , schools with a large student body , a weak college community , or no history of student self-governance will not be able to support a full honor code . However , while modified honor codes seem to be more effective than faculty or administration run integrity codes of conduct , research",0
"in any current statute , either criminal or civil . Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights . In short , people are asked to use the guideline , `` if you did not write it yourself ; you must give credit '' . Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement . Although both terms may apply to a particular act , they are different concepts , and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright . Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder , when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent . Plagiarism , in contrast , is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author 's reputation , or the obtaining of academic credit , that is achieved through false claims of authorship . Thus , plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist 's audience ( for example , a reader , listener , or teacher ) .

"The 18th century new morals were institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia ( including academic science , education , engineering etc . ) and journalism , where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics , subject to sanctions like expulsion and other severe career damages . Not so in the arts , which have resisted in their long-established tradition of copying as a fundamental practice of the creative process . As of the 21st century , artists continue to tolerate plagiarism . Plagiarism is not a crime but is disapproved more on the grounds of moral offence . Since 2000 , discussions on the subjects of student plagiarism have increased with a major strand of this discussion centering on the issue of how best students can be helped to understand and avoid plagiarism . Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students , there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism .

She alleged that they `` willfully cut down 'ancient ' juniper trees on her property to improve their view '' and requested $ 150,000 in damages . The plaintiff 's lawyer alleged , `` It 's not just like they 're on the property line . They 're 250 , 300 feet onto","in any current statute , either criminal or civil . Some cases may be treated as unfair competition or a violation of the doctrine of moral rights . In short , people are asked to use the guideline , `` if you did not write it yourself ; you must give credit '' . Plagiarism is not the same as copyright infringement . Although both terms may apply to a particular act , they are different concepts , and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright . Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder , when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent . Plagiarism , in contrast , is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author 's reputation , or the obtaining of academic credit , that is achieved through false claims of authorship . Thus , plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist 's audience ( for example , a reader , listener , or teacher ) . Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in",0

Peer pressure works both ways , as a study found that there is a 41 % increase in the probability of a student cheating if they have seen someone else cheat . However , even if most students strongly disapprove of cheating , there has to be a community in order for those norms to be enforced via peer pressure . For instance , larger schools , which usually have much higher cheating rates than small schools , tend to have a weaker community , being more split up into different peer groups that exert little social pressure on each other . Another measure of a college community , how many students live on campus , further shows a significant relation with a school 's cheating rate . Relatedly , many professors argue that smaller classes reduce cheating behavior . === Ethical causes === No matter what the demographic or contextual influences are on a student who decides to engage in cheating behavior , before they can cheat they must overcome their own conscience . This depends both on how strongly someone disapproves of academic dishonesty and what types of justifications the student uses to escape",0

'' Though this phrase appears to be praising artistic plagiarism , it is more commonly taken to refer to constructively iterating upon the work of others , and being transparent about one 's influences . == Self-plagiarism == The reuse of significant , identical , or nearly identical portions of one 's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as self-plagiarism or recycling fraud . Scholarly articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or multiple publication . Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material , such as in publishing or factual documentation . It does not apply to public-interest texts , such as social , professional , and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines . Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is accepted both legally ( as fair use ) and ethically . In addition , there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity . Many people","the student . Another study suggests that plagiarism detection software is rarely used , while university teachers try to detect plagiarism through careful reading . This study also found that different versions of tests are used comparatively infrequently in examinations , for example by trying to ensure sufficient distance between students or by ensuring that enough supervisors are present . According to a manual for professors on cheating , Similarly , a survey found that university teachers were less likely to engage in different methods of preventing and detecting academic dishonesty if they rated perceived effort as too high , perceived effectiveness as too low , external expectations that such behaviour should be enforced as too low , or if they did not strongly disapprove of academic dishonesty . Such reasons have been also observed in other studies . There are other reasons as well . Some professors are reluctant to report violations to the appropriate authorities because they believe the punishment to be too harsh . Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating in their classes below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers , as they are rated by how many research papers",0

"Learning Representations from Dendrograms We propose unsupervised representation learning and feature extraction from dendrograms . The commonly used Minimax distance measures correspond to building a dendrogram with single linkage criterion , with defining specific forms of a level function and a distance function over that . Therefore , we extend this method to arbitrary dendrograms . We develop a generalized framework wherein different distance measures and representations can be inferred from different types of dendrograms , level functions and distance functions . Via an appropriate embedding , we compute a vector-based representation of the inferred distances , in order to enable many numerical machine learning algorithms to employ such distances . Then , to address the model selection problem , we study the aggregation of different dendrogram-based distances respectively in solution space and in representation space in the spirit of deep representations . In the first approach , for example for the clustering problem , we build a graph with positive and negative edge weights according to the consistency of the clustering labels of different objects among different solutions , in the context of ensemble methods .

"a parent . === Honor codes === First at the College of William and Mary in 1779 , and then followed by schools like the University of Virginia in the 1850s and Wesleyan University in 1893 , the students , with the agreement of faculty who declared themselves dedicated to ideals of democracy and human character , created honor codes . B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign , a student controlled judiciary that hears alleged violations , unproctored examinations , and an obligation for all students help enforce the code . === Mixed judicial boards === However , many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty . This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes . Moreover , many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly . In response to these concerns , in the middle of the twentieth century , many schools devised mixed judicial panels composed of both students and","in modern Hindi cinema : `` The extent of Urdu used in commercial Hindi cinema has not been stable ... the ultimate victory of Hindi in the official sphere has been more or less complete .

In the Boldt case , the editors-in-chief of 18 specialist journals ( generally anesthesia and intensive care ) made a joint statement regarding 88 published clinical trials conducted without Ethics Committee approval .

To minimize plagiarism in the digital era , it is crucial that students understand the definition of plagiarism and how important intellectual property rights are . Students should be aware that correct attribution is required to prevent the accusation of plagiarism and that the ethical and legal rules that apply to printed materials also apply to electronic information . == In journalism == In journalism , plagiarism is considered a breach of journalistic ethics , and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment . Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally , by failing to include quotations or to give the appropriate citation . Although plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history , the development of the Internet , where articles appear as electronic text , has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier . Because journalism relies on the public trust , a reporter 's failure to acknowledge sources honestly undercuts a newspaper or television news show 's integrity and undermines its credibility .

B. Melendez of Harvard University defined an honor code as a code of academic conduct that includes a written pledge of honesty that students sign , a student controlled judiciary that hears alleged violations , unproctored examinations , and an obligation for all students help enforce the code . === Mixed judicial boards === However , many people doubted the advisability of relying on an abstract notion of honor to prevent academic dishonesty . This doubt has perhaps led to the reality that no more than a quarter of American universities have adopted honor codes . Moreover , many professors could not envisage a student run trial process that treated faculty accusers fairly .

Although the type of manipulation that is allowed can depend greatly on the type of experiment that is presented and also differ from one journal to another , in general the following manipulations are not allowed : splicing together different images to represent a single experiment changing brightness and contrast of only a part of the image any change that conceals information , even when it is considered to be non-specific , which includes : changing brightness and contrast to leave only the most intense signal using clone tools to hide information showing only a very small part of the photograph so that additional information is not visible Image manipulations are typically done on visually repetitive images such as those of blots and microscope images . == Motivations == According to David Goodstein of Caltech","Rachel Hollis ( ; ) is an American author , motivational speaker , and blogger .

"exists that automatically generates music in the style of another composer , using musical analysis of their works . Most notably , David Cope has written a software system called `` Experiments in Musical Intelligence '' ( or `` EMI '' ) that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style . EMI 's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence . For this reason , Cope 's work has been said to not produce original music . A different approach is being followed by Melomics , a technology focused on teaching computers the rules of music composition , not the works of previous composers . This technology has opened the way to truly creative computer-composers , like Iamus and Melomics109 . The records produced ( Iamus ' album and 0music ) are in the computer 's own style , so they can not be considered a pastiche or plagiarism of previous works . According to Theodor W.

Furthermore , the commission 's neutrality was disputed as the University of Bayreuth was party to the proceedings .

Taking all this in account , the Board made a decision on plagiarism , which was described as `` evident and indisputable '' . Mali 's complaints on the process were dismissed , with detailed explanation of the regulations . Regarding Mali 's complaint that he was n't allowed to participate in the process , the Board said that Mali sent his reply to the FON 's request on 14 December 2016 , while all documentation regarding the matter was sent by the Board to him so he was n't excluded .

"person improperly . Ghostwriting describes when someone other than the named author ( s ) makes a major contribution to the research . Sometimes , this is done to mask contributions from authors with a conflict of interest . In other cases , a ghost authorship occurs where the ghost author sells the research paper to a colleague who wants the publication in order to boost their publishing metrics . Guest authorship is the phenomenon wherein authorship is given to someone who has not made any substantial contribution . This can be done by senior researchers who muscle their way onto the papers of inexperienced junior researchers as well as others that stack authorship in an effort to guarantee publication . This is much harder to prove due to a lack of consistency in defining `` authorship '' or `` substantial contribution '' .

Furthermore , plagiarism detection systems ( PDS ) , especially when used for grading purposes , have certain drawbacks . While Turnitin can identify matching texts , it does not provide a clear definition of plagiarism , leaving potential disputes for individual interpretation . For example , different instructors may interpret the same report with varying explanations . The extent of plagiarism can vary significantly , ranging from a single paragraph to multiple instances within a five to six page paper . Without a rigorous standard that defines plagiarism , instructors defining plagiarism based on their own understanding can lead to confusion and conflicts . === Plagiarism education === Though widely employed in high schools and universities , plagiarism detection tools create a delicate environment in the classroom ,",0

Sotto had been pushing for the restoration of the death penalty since he took office as a senator in 1992 . He changed his stance on the penalty in 2021 when he entered the vice-presidential race in the upcoming 2022 presidential election , believing life imprisonment to be a better alternative . He and his presidential running mate Panfilo Lacson agree that the issue should be concentrated on improving jail conditions , advocating the construction of regional penitentiaries where criminals convicted of a heinous crime could be incarcerated if not in New Bilibid Prison",0

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism .

"Beyond Volume : The Impact of Complex Healthcare Data on the Machine Learning Pipeline From medical charts to national census , healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm . However , the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age . Ranging from electronic health records , to digitized imaging and laboratory reports , to public health datasets , today , healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information . Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration . Unfortunately , the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models . Rather , a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success . While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records , it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data . In fact , drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set","finds specific passages of text in one document that match text in another document . == Software-assisted plagiarism detection == Computer-assisted plagiarism detection is an Information retrieval ( IR ) task supported by specialized IR systems , which is referred to as a plagiarism detection system ( PDS ) or document similarity detection system . A 2019 systematic literature review presents an overview of state-of-the-art plagiarism detection methods . === In text documents === Systems for text similarity detection implement one of two generic detection approaches , one being external , the other being intrinsic . External detection systems compare a suspicious document with a reference collection , which is a set of documents assumed to be genuine . Based on a chosen document model and predefined similarity criteria , the detection task is to retrieve all documents that contain text that is similar to a degree above a chosen threshold to text in the suspicious document . Intrinsic PDSes solely analyze the text to be evaluated without performing comparisons to external documents . This approach aims to recognize changes in the unique writing style of an author as an indicator for potential plagiarism . PDSes are not capable of",0

"English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson during the Jacobean Era to describe someone guilty of literary theft . The derived form plagiarism was introduced into English around 1620 . The Latin words plagiārius ( `` kidnapper '' ) and plagium ( `` kidnapping '' ) have the same root : plaga ( `` snare '' , `` net '' ) , which is based on the Indo-European root * -plak , `` to weave '' . It is frequently claimed that people in antiquity had no concept of plagiarism , or at least did not condemn it , and that it only came to be seen as immoral much later , anywhere from the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th century to the Romantic movement in the 18th century . Although people in antiquity found detecting plagiarism difficult due to long travel times and scarcity of literate persons , there are a considerable number of pre-Enlightenment authors who accused others of plagiarism and considered it distasteful and scandalous , including historians Polybius and Pliny the Elder . The 3rd century Greek work Lives of the Eminent Philosophers mentions that Heraclides Ponticus was accused of plagiarizing ( κλέψαντα αὐτὸν )","ALERT-Transformer : Bridging Asynchronous and Synchronous Machine Learning for Real-Time Event-based Spatio-Temporal Data We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models . We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas : ( 1 ) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism , ( 2 ) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate , ( 3 ) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method . These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition . Using this approach , we achieve performances at the state-of-the-art with a lower latency than competitors . We also demonstrate that our asynchronous model can operate at any desired sampling rate .",0

Under the ironic gaze of postmodernism , the distinctions between guilt and innocence , integrity and deceit permeating the scandal debates appear irrelevant . '' However , there is an argument that postmodernism is just moral relativism , therefore cheating is condoned as a valid academic method , even if it is morally and legally wrong .

"According to one survey of American college students , while 50 % had cheated at least once in the previous six months , and 7 % had cheated more than five times in that period , only 2.5 % of the cheaters had been caught .

Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior . It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat , probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered .

The authors of a 2019 systematic literature review on academic plagiarism detection derived a four-leven typology of academic plagiarism , from the total words of a language ( lexis ) , from its syntax , from its semantics , and from methods to capture plagiarism of ideas and structures . The typology categorizes plagiarism forms according to the layer of the model they affect : Characters-preserving plagiarism Verbatim copying without proper citation Syntax-preserving plagiarism Synonym substitution Technical disguise ( e.g. , using identically looking glyphs from another alphabet ) Semantics-preserving plagiarism Translation Paraphrase Idea-preserving plagiarism Appropriation of ideas or concepts Reusing text structure Ghostwriting Collusion ( typically among students ) Contract cheating === Factors influencing students ' decisions to plagiarize === Several studies investigated factors predicting the decision to plagiarize .
